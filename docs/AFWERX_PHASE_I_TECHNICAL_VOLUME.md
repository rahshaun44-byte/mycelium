#### 2. Technical Abstract
Tactical military datalinks, airborne edge nodes, and satellite communications face an acute, compounding operational crisis: **cryptographic brittleness under staged post-quantum migration, unmitigated computational exhaustion from hostile socket injection, and supply-chain binary tampering**. Conventional network gateways parse and log malformed ingress, triggering CPU saturation, heap memory accumulation, and service restarts during key rollover that degrade contested tactical operations.

**QuantumFlex** resolves this crisis through the **eQUATION OF TRUTH** ($\mathbf{Y = (x - h) + k}$). QuantumFlex is an autonomous, software-defined cryptographic agility sidecar and shock-absorbing telemetry architecture that:
1. **Decouples High-Throughput Cryptography from Policy Supervision:** Separates a standalone C++20 cryptographic engine (`quantumflex`) from dynamic Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego evaluation sidecars, executing sub-35ms in-memory cipher swaps without tearing down active data sockets.
2. **Eliminates Computational Exhaustion via EWMA Shock Absorption:** Intercepts unauthenticated or forged binary packets at the socket ingress boundary, utilizing a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (EWMA LIF) sentinel that shunts toxic perturbations into an isolated Ghost Node entropy sink (applying a Landauer-inspired information-cost analogy) without degrading host CPU or memory cadence.
3. **Guarantees Provable Memory Cleansing:** Overwrites all ephemeral lattice secrets, Shamir polynomial shards, and recovery keys using compiler-barrier `OPENSSL_cleanse` routines, empirically verified under Valgrind with zero memory leaks.
4. **Enforces TOCTOU-Resistant Runtime Admission:** Binds runtime execution directly to cryptographically attested source packages via the QF-A6 admission gate, opening binaries with `O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC`, verifying digital signatures over the open descriptor, sanitizing dynamic loader environments (`LD_PRELOAD`), and executing via `fexecve(fd)`—closing on-disk executable path-substitution races.

During this 90-day Phase I feasibility study, the contractor will execute ≥30 structured customer discovery interviews across candidate Air Force stakeholders (PEO Cyber and Networks, AFRL Information Directorate, and Space Systems Command), construct an automated ACVP-compatible NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) pre-validation test harness, validate hardware security enclave integration (TPM 2.0, Titan M2, Knox Vault), and formulate a Phase II demonstration architecture for tactical pod and datalink integration.

### [PAGES 2–4] Technical Merit & Feasibility

#### [PAGE 2] Theoretical Formulation — The eQUATION OF TRUTH ($Y = (x - h) + k$)
Distributed tactical computing enclaves operating in contested electromagnetic and cyber environments are governed by high-velocity environmental entropy ($x$), hostile adversarial anomalies ($h$), and deterministic system invariants ($k$). Standard software architectures conflate these layers, allowing hostile inputs ($h$) to contaminate operational state ($Y$) and consume scarce edge resources.

QuantumFlex mathematically restructures this relationship through the **eQUATION OF TRUTH**:
$$\mathbf{Y = (x - h) + k}$$

* **$\mathbf{x}$ (Environmental Tactical Variables):** The high-velocity operational entropy of tactical edge communications—dynamic physical telemetry (e.g., host RAM consumption at 62.8%, thermal fluctuations at 48.0°C), bursty incoming socket frames over tactical radios, and asynchronous multi-tenant message ingress.
* **$\mathbf{h}$ (Adversarial Friction & Anomalies):** Malicious perturbations and hostile vectors—forged Ed25519 signatures, malformed binary wire protocol frames (QFXK), memory scraping, on-disk executable substitution races, and asynchronous webhook retry race conditions.
* **$\mathbf{k}$ (Baseline Invariant Stability):** Deterministic mathematical and cryptographic guarantees enforced at the machine-code and kernel boundaries:
  1. *Sub-Millisecond EWMA LIF Sentinel:* Implements an exponential leaky integrate-and-fire membrane potential:
     $$V_{\text{membrane}}[t] = \lambda \cdot V_{\text{membrane}}[t-1] + (1 - \lambda) \cdot \text{AnomalyCost}(p_t)$$
     Hostile packets that violate protocol framing or fail cryptographic checks immediately elevate the membrane potential. Upon reaching the threshold $V_{\text{th}}$, the socket fails-closed, shunting packets into an isolated Ghost Node entropy sink (drawing upon a Landauer-inspired information-cost analogy to prevent computational heat and host exhaustion) without CPU spikes or thread blocking.
  2. *Branchless Constant-Time Cryptography:* Zero data-dependent branching during post-quantum decapsulation (ML-KEM-768/1024), eliminating timing side-channel leakage.
  3. *Compiler-Barrier Memory Destruction:* Enforcing explicit zeroization of ephemeral state via `OPENSSL_cleanse` across heap and stack boundaries before process exit.
  4. *Declarative OPA Rego Admission Gate:* Evaluating active cipher health against declarative policies, executing atomic configuration rewrites (`os.replace` / POSIX `SIGHUP`) with sub-35ms latency.
* **$\mathbf{Y}$ (Purified Operational State):** The purified operational reality—simultaneously recorded into structured relational audit ledgers (**AMARA PostgreSQL 15**) for microsecond compliance traceability, semantically indexed into local neural vector memory (**Athena ChromaDB RAG**) for natural-language situational awareness, and executed exclusively through cryptographically admitted binaries.

#### [PAGE 3] Decoupled Engine Architecture & TOCTOU-Resistant Runtime Admission
Conventional cryptographic architectures tightly couple wire protocol handling, algorithm execution, and policy decision-making into single monolithic executables. Under this legacy model, updating an algorithm requires recompiling the core application, halting active datalinks, and risking supply-chain binary substitution on edge non-volatile storage.

QuantumFlex enforces strict architectural decoupling between the **Cryptographic Data Plane** and the **Supervisory Policy Control Plane**, secured by an unbroken cryptographic chain of custody:

```

1. **Standalone Data Plane Isolation (`quantumflex`):**
   The cryptographic primitives (`qflex_crypto`) and wire protocol (`wire`) are carved into an independent, standalone C++20 repository (`quantumflex`). In-tree source compilation and installed packages are mutually exclusive (CMake XOR admission rule: `ATTESTED` mode requires signed installed packages; `DEV` mode restricts to in-tree testing), eliminating duplicate target collisions and ensuring deterministic receipt generation (`QuantumFlexAdmission.json`).
2. **QF-A4 Pre-Link Hash Verification:**
   Before any linking occurs, the CMake admission gate (`cmake/AdmitQuantumFlex.cmake`) calculates raw SHA-256 byte digests of all installed static archives (`libquantumflex_crypto.a`, `libquantumflex_wire.a`) and public headers against the admission receipt. Any byte modification causes CMake configuration to fail-closed immediately.
3. **QF-A5 External Provenance Authority:**
   Package authenticity is governed by a canonical detached Ed25519 provenance manifest (`QuantumFlexAdmission.provenance.json` / `.sig`). This manifest is verified by an independent host-anchored verifier (`~/.local/libexec/quantumflex/verify-provenance`) referencing an isolated public trust anchor (`release_signing_key.pub`) held with strict `0400` permissions. The trust anchor resides strictly outside the repository tree, preventing circular supply-chain self-attestation.
4. **QF-A6 TOCTOU-Resistant Runtime Admission ($\text{EXECUTED\_FD} == \text{VERIFIED\_FD}$):**
   Standard Linux process execution via `execve(path)` is inherently vulnerable to Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions: an attacker or rogue process with local storage access can swap an admitted binary on disk between the moment a security daemon checks its hash and the moment the kernel invokes it.
   The `qf-runtime-admit` engine closes this specific executable path-substitution race through kernel-level file-descriptor pinning:
   * The launcher opens the target binary with `O_RDONLY | O_CLOEXEC`.
   * It calculates the SHA-256 digest and verifies the Ed25519 digital signature directly over the open file descriptor (`fd`).
   * It completely purges the dynamic loader environment, stripping `LD_PRELOAD`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and unauthorized environment overrides.
   * It executes the binary directly from the open descriptor using the `fexecve(fd, argv, envp)` system call.
   Because the file descriptor pins the exact inode and data blocks verified in memory, on-disk file swapping is mathematically defeated ($EXECUTED\_FD == VERIFIED\_FD$).
5. **Zero-Trust Network Perimeter:**
   Internal daemons bind strictly to loopback `127.0.0.1:9000`. Remote mesh connectivity is mediated exclusively via Tailscale Serve MagicDNS HTTPS (`https://fedora.taild1b451.ts.net/`) and tailnet TCP forwarders (`100.108.244.64:9000`), terminating TLS internally with zero open ports exposed to physical local Wi-Fi or LAN interfaces (`192.168.0.x`).

#### Detailed Empirical Narrative:
1. **Memory Cleansing & Zeroization (`CL-01`):**
   Full leak verification conducted under Valgrind Memcheck 3.27.1 on the Shamir secret recovery engine (`tools/genesis_tool.cpp`) and zeroization suite (`tools/test_zeroization.cpp`). Post-recovery inspection confirmed that `OPENSSL_cleanse` overwrote 100% of secret shard buffers on both heap and stack, leaving `0 bytes in use at exit in 0 blocks` across 37 total allocations and 37 frees.
2. **Measured EWMA Response Under Controlled Hostile Socket Injection (`CL-02`):**
   Under continuous injection of forged Ed25519 signatures and malformed QFXK wire frames, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire sentinel rejected 100% of adversarial packets at socket ingress. Nominal telemetry streaming maintained an unbroken cadence of **15.01 seconds** (nominal target: 15.00s; cadence jitter $\Delta < 0.1\%$) with zero CPU spikes or thread exhaustion.
3. **Shamir Threshold Unlock Latency (`CL-03`):**
   Benchmarking the transition of the cryptographic core from `LOCKED` to `ACTIVE` across a 2-of-3 Shamir threshold ceremony yielded a completed state transition in **4.651 ms**, enabling near-instantaneous key recovery under tactical edge constraints.
4. **Decoupled Intake Acknowledgment (`CL-04`):**
   Durable telemetry intake benchmarks across 9 test suites demonstrated that HTTP 202 client receipts return in **3.9–8.5 ms** (average 6.29 ms) locally, completely decoupled from local neural inference latency. SQLite WAL persistence with `synchronous=FULL` guarantees durability prior to socket release.
5. **Comprehensive Automated Test Battery (`CL-06`):**
   The unified test battery at commit `31ed9c9` achieved 100% determinism: 30 of 30 tests passed in 0.42s covering external verifier security (6), zero-loss Kafka consumer offset commits (7), intake lease fencing (3), mobile CLI role segregation (5), mobile distribution signatures (4), and mobile OTA routes (5). The single warning recorded (`DeprecationWarning: anyio.abc.BlockingPortal alias is deprecated`) is classified as a **benign external dependency notice** in Starlette TestClient with zero operational impact.
6. **Regulatory Demarcation (`CL-14`):**
   In strict compliance with federal procurement governance, NIST CMVP and CAVP certificates are recorded as `NULL`. QuantumFlex is an internal pre-validation engineering research prototype designed to prime formal accredited laboratory evaluation during SBIR Phase II.

### [PAGE 5] Operational Defense Problem & Opportunity

#### 1. The Strategic Post-Quantum Mandate
National Security Systems are entering a staged transition toward post-quantum cryptography under CNSA 2.0 and related federal migration policy, creating an engineering need for crypto-agile systems that can validate, replace, and operationally bind cryptographic components without introducing uncontrolled runtime or supply-chain state. NSA's published draft CSfC PQC guidance (**CSfC Post Quantum Cryptography Guidance Addendum 1.0, Draft .5**) lays out a staged transition requirement for new products and services in applicable Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) contexts beginning in **2027**, with broader migration milestones extending through **2030–2031** (and NSM-10 targeting **2035** for full NSS migration). ML-KEM and ML-DSA themselves are finalized NIST standards under **FIPS 203** and **FIPS 204**.

1. **Single-Lattice Fragility & Harvest-Now-Decrypt-Later (HNDL):**
   Adversarial nation-states are actively recording encrypted military radio, datalink, and satellite communications today with the intent to decrypt them once cryptanalytic capabilities or large-scale quantum computers mature. Furthermore, virtually all defense PQC implementations rely exclusively on Module-Lattice cryptography (NIST FIPS 203/204). If an unexpected algebraic breakthrough impairs structured lattices, deployed tactical aircraft will face immediate communications blackout requiring physical depot hardware refits.
2. **Computational Exhaustion & Host Resource Starvation:**
   Standard military data gateways attempt to parse, deserialize, buffer, and audit every incoming network packet. Under intentional adversarial jamming or forged signature flooding, tactical edge computers (constrained by strict size, weight, power, and thermal limits) suffer severe CPU saturation and memory leaks, starving core avionics flight software of compute cycles.
3. **On-Disk Binary Swapping on Contested Edge Hardware:**
   Tactical edge nodes receiving Over-The-Air (OTA) software and algorithm updates risk Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use race conditions. Malicious processes resident on the device can overwrite verified executables on non-volatile flash storage immediately before kernel execution, bypassing static hash checks.

#### 3. The Defense Innovation Opportunity
There is an immediate requirement for an autonomous, software-defined **Crypto-Agility and Shock-Absorption Sidecar** that can be retrofitted onto existing tactical datalinks. QuantumFlex solves this operational gap by decoupling cryptography from control logic, filtering hostile packets under controlled socket-load and adversarial network-stress testing, and mathematically binding executable file descriptors in kernel memory without requiring airframe redesign.

#### [PAGE 9] Commercialization Business Model & Intellectual Property Strategy
FINALLYFUNGUS LLC will commercialize QuantumFlex through a structured commercial licensing model and statutory SBIR data rights framework:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                  COMMERCIALIZATION & DATA RIGHTS FRAMEWORK                              |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Commercial Enterprise Tier                             | Defense Sector: SBIR Data Rights Framework     |
+--------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| * Per-Node Annual Subscription: $1,200–$4,800/yr       | * DFARS 252.227-7018 SBIR Data Rights apply    |
| * Dynamic CBOM Generation & Continuous Asset Discovery | * Technical Data: Limited Rights for 20 years  |

### [PAGE 10] Prior, Related & Competitor Work

#### 1. Prior Work Developed by Offeror (Self-Assessed TRL-4 Baseline)
FINALLYFUNGUS LLC has self-funded and engineered an operational, laboratory-validated prototype system (`QuantumFlex` / `mycelium`), establishing a proven self-assessed TRL 4 baseline:
* **Standalone Cryptographic Data Plane:** Fully modular C++20 engine containing NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM-768/1024), FrodoKEM-976, and X25519 primitives, decoupled from host control logic.
* **Host-Anchored External Verifier:** Created `verify-provenance` binary and CMake admission gate (`AdmitQuantumFlex.cmake`) enforcing strict XOR developer vs attested package exclusivity.
* **Kernel-Bound Runtime Admission Launcher:** Created `qf-runtime-admit` utility closing on-disk executable path-substitution races via `fexecve(fd)`.
* **Automated 30-Test Regression Suite:** Validated 100% deterministic test execution across unit, integration, and security test harnesses in 0.42s at commit `31ed9c9`.

#### 2. Competitor Analysis & State-of-the-Art Differentiation
Conventional market solutions fail to provide the combined attributes of post-quantum algorithm agility, socket-level shock absorption, and binary execution binding required by tactical defense enclaves:

```

* **Versus Traditional VPN Gateways:** Standard protocols (IPsec, OpenVPN, WireGuard) require full cryptographic renegotiation and socket teardown during key rotation, severing active airborne RF datalinks. Under packet flooding attacks, they parse headers into memory, causing CPU saturation. QuantumFlex switches ciphers in $< 35\text{ ms}$ in memory without socket drops and drops malicious packets via branchless LIF filtering.
* **Versus Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** While HSMs offer physical tamper protection, they are heavy, power-hungry, expensive, and require physical replacement or firmware re-flashing to support new post-quantum standards. QuantumFlex provides software-defined agility on edge compute platforms and tactical single-board architectures.

### [PAGE 13] Key Personnel, Facilities & Corporate Transparency

#### 1. Principal Investigator & Key Personnel
* **Rahshaun Chambers (Lead Systems Architect & Principal Investigator):**
  * *Role & Commitment:* **320 Phase I direct project hours; PI primarily employed by the SBC during performance** (fully satisfying SBA requirements that the PI's primary employment be with the small business concern at the time of award and throughout the period of performance). Dedicated to technical execution across all 3 Phase I tasks (~26.7 direct hours/week).
  * *Technical Background:* Founder of QuantumFlex and lead architect of the `mycelium` code repository. Academic background in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), with foundational coursework in operating systems, software engineering, algorithms, and discrete mathematics.
  * *Core Competencies:* Direct experience architecting decoupled C++20 and Rust cryptographic engines, POSIX signal inter-process communication, Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego sidecar integration, Ed25519 provenance validation gates, and kernel-level `fexecve` file-descriptor execution binding.
* **Subcontractors & Independent Consultants ($5,000 ODC):**
  * The contractor will engage an independent cryptographic consultant with formal NVLAP accredited laboratory evaluation experience to perform pre-assessment reviews of the automated ACVP test bench, entropy interfaces, and memory zeroization routines.

#### 2. Corporate Demarcation & Entity Disclosure
In strict adherence to federal procurement integrity standards:
* **Applicant Firm:** FINALLYFUNGUS LLC (PA Entity ID: 13706513, Pittston, PA) DBA QuantumFlex.
* **Commercial Baseline:** Established commercial line operating in agricultural and cultivation supply products.
* **Research Line:** QuantumFlex operates as an early-stage cybersecurity and post-quantum software R&D initiative chartered to resolve algorithmic brittleness and data hoarding in national security systems.
* **Foreign Ownership & Control:** FINALLYFUNGUS LLC is 100% American-owned and operated. **No known foreign ownership, control, or influence identified in company records as of submission.**

#### 3. Facilities & Prototype Laboratory Baseline
QuantumFlex is currently developed and validated on a **laptop-centered physical prototype laboratory** rather than specialized military or rack-mounted test equipment. The primary engineering node is a Lenovo Yoga 7 running Fedora Linux, providing the C++20 runtime, cryptographic test environment, container isolation, local policy enforcement, and hardware-backed TPM functionality. A secondary HP Pavilion node is used for distributed-worker and network-path testing, while supported mobile devices provide additional hardware-rooted trust and remote-operator test vectors.

Network and adversarial testing is performed through controlled loopback, isolated container networks, and private mesh paths, allowing repeatable injection of malformed frames, stalled connections, tampered artifacts, provenance failures, and runtime-admission attacks without exposing the prototype to an uncontrolled external network.

This environment has been sufficient to establish laboratory-scale feasibility for memory zeroization, cryptographic admission, fail-closed runtime binding, telemetry behavior, and controlled socket-stress testing. It is not represented as flight-qualified, radiation-hardened, tactical line-rate, or operationally representative Department of the Air Force hardware.

Phase I will use the existing prototype environment as the validated baseline while determining, through customer discovery, the representative compute, interface, SWaP-C, cryptographic-module, and network-emulation hardware required for a Phase II operational demonstration. In summary, QuantumFlex is running on a real multi-node physical prototype environment today, but the present environment is laboratory-grade rather than representative tactical hardware. Phase I explicitly uses customer discovery to determine and procure the representative compute, cryptographic, and network interfaces required for the next-stage demonstration.
