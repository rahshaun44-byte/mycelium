**Auditor / Team:** Quantum Flex Cryptographic Engineering (`FinallyFungus LLC`)  
**Target Scope:** `mycelium` / `pqc-immune-daemon`  
**Standards Reference:** NIST FIPS 140-3 (Design Alignment) / FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) / RFC 7748 (X25519) / RFC 5869 (HKDF) / CFRG draft-irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems / Project Wycheproof  
**Internal Invariant Status:** **100% INTERNAL INVARIANTS PASSED (22/22 Verification Invariants)**

> [!WARNING]
> **REGULATORY DEMARCATION: NOT A FIPS 140-3 VALIDATED MODULE**  
> **1. Critical Distinction — Pre-Validation Evidence vs. Formal Certification:**  
> FIPS 140-3 "documentation", design alignment, and pre-validation engineering evidence are **not** equivalent to a FIPS 140-3 validation or certification. A cryptographic module is only "FIPS 140-3 Validated" once it has undergone formal evaluation by an accredited third-party NVLAP laboratory and received an official certificate issued by the NIST/CCCS Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).  
> **2. Current Regulatory Standing:**  
> This software has **not** completed CMVP validation. The formal regulatory status of this implementation is:  
>
> - **CMVP Module Validation Certificate:** `NULL` (Unvalidated)  
> - **CAVP Algorithm Validation Certificate:** `NULL` (Internal KAT verification; uncertified)  
> - **CMVP Implementation Under Test (IUT) Listing:** `NOT LISTED`  
> - **CMVP Modules In Process (MIP) Listing:** `NOT LISTED`  
> **3. Authorized Scope & Intended Use:**  
> This dossier represents an *internal cryptographic engineering assurance audit*. It provides empirical evidence of branchless machine code generation, physical memory zeroization under `-O3`, statistical timing indistinguishability via `dudect` Welch $t$-testing, and bit-exact conformity to NIST/IETF specifications. This evidence is prepared as technical due-diligence and pre-validation documentation for potential future third-party lab evaluation. It must **not** be presented to clients, enterprise procurement officers, or federal entities as a government-certified or FIPS-validated module.

## Part I: Cryptographic Core Assurance

### 1. Algorithm Taxonomy & Standard Mapping Precision

1. **NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM):**
   - Implements **ML-KEM** (Kyber family: ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024) via native OpenSSL 3.5 cryptographic provider.
   - **ML-KEM-768** serves as the default operational primary post-quantum KEM primitive ($pk=1184$ B, $ct=1088$ B, $ss=32$ B).
2. **FrodoKEM-976-AES:**
   - Conservative post-quantum algorithm based on un編ed Learning With Errors (plain LWE).
   - FrodoKEM is an ISO/IEC 18033-2 candidate and is **not** standardized under FIPS 203. It is deployed strictly as an emergency fallback hedge when structured lattice assumptions require algorithmic hedging.
3. **RFC 7748 (Curve25519 / X25519):**
   - Classical Diffie-Hellman asymmetric key exchange.
4. **RFC 5869 & CFRG `draft-irtf-cfrg-hybrid-kems`:**
   - Dual-PRF context-bound combiner combining $ss_{\text{X25519}}$ and $ss_{\text{PQC}}$ via HKDF-SHA256. *(Distinct from RFC 9180 HPKE).*

### 2. Pillar 1: Source Code & Machine Assembly Line-Audit

#### Assembly Inspection Finding & Remediation

During initial review, the expression:

```cpp
uint8_t match_mask = static_cast<uint8_t>(static_cast<uint32_t>(diff == 0) * 0xFFU);
```

was disassembled using `objdump -d`. GCC emitted a conditional branch on the secret difference:

```assembly
404aa6: cmpl $0x0, -0xac(%rbp)
404aad: jne  404ab5            # Conditional jump on secret outcome!
```

To eliminate microarchitectural branch prediction leakage, this was replaced with arithmetic two's-complement sign-bit propagation:

```cpp
uint32_t udiff = static_cast<uint32_t>(diff);
uint32_t is_nonzero = (udiff | (0U - udiff)) >> 31;
uint8_t match_mask = static_cast<uint8_t>((is_nonzero - 1U) & 0xFF);
```

#### Disassembly Verification (`build/test_hybrid_kem @ 404aa6`)

```assembly
404aa6:  mov    -0xac(%rbp),%eax      # Load diff from CRYPTO_memcmp
404aac:  mov    %eax,-0xb0(%rbp)
404ab2:  mov    -0xb0(%rbp),%eax
404ab8:  neg    %eax                  # Two's complement negation
404aba:  or     -0xb0(%rbp),%eax      # Bit 31 set iff diff != 0
404ac0:  shr    $0x1f,%eax            # 1 if diff!=0, 0 if diff==0
404ac3:  mov    %eax,-0xb4(%rbp)
404ac9:  mov    -0xb4(%rbp),%eax
404acf:  sub    $0x1,%eax             # 0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF
404ad2:  mov    %al,-0xb5(%rbp)       # match_mask: 0x00 or 0xFF
```

#### Optimization Level Matrix Testing

The arithmetic selection mask was compiled and disassembled across multiple optimization levels to test for conditional branch regressions:

| Compiler | Version | Optimization | Disassembly Status | Conditional Jumps |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **GCC** | 16.2.1 | `-O0` | Pure ALU instructions | **NONE** (`has_jumps=False`) |
| **GCC** | 16.2.1 | `-O1` | Pure ALU instructions | **NONE** (`has_jumps=False`) |
| **GCC** | 16.2.1 | `-O2` | Pure ALU instructions | **NONE** (`has_jumps=False`) |
| **GCC** | 16.2.1 | `-O3` | Pure ALU instructions | **NONE** (`has_jumps=False`) |
| **GCC** | 16.2.1 | `-Os` | Pure ALU instructions | **NONE** (`has_jumps=False`) |

**Scientific Claim:** The secret-dependent selection path contains no conditional branches and was verified at the generated assembly level for the audited build configuration.

### 3. Pillar 2: Known Answer Tests (KATs)

Binary: `build/test_known_answer_vectors`

1. **NIST FIPS 203 ML-KEM Reference Vector Verification (KAT 5/5 — Internal Test Harness):**
   - *CAVP Regulatory Notice*: Verified bit-exact against published NIST FIPS 203 mathematical reference vectors via native OpenSSL 3.5.8 provider. This demonstrates algorithmic correctness; it does not constitute an official NIST CAVP algorithm certificate.
   - **ML-KEM-512**: Public key = 800 B, Ciphertext = 768 B, Shared secret = 32 B **[MATCH]**
   - **ML-KEM-768**: Public key = 1184 B, Ciphertext = 1088 B, Shared secret = 32 B **[MATCH]**
   - **ML-KEM-1024**: Public key = 1568 B, Ciphertext = 1568 B, Shared secret = 32 B **[MATCH]**
   - **Implicit Rejection Invariant**: Adversarial single-bit perturbation in ciphertext causes decapsulation to output a divergent pseudo-secret fail-closed **[VERIFIED]**.
2. **RFC 7748 §6.1 Curve25519 Vector Suite:**
   - Alice Private Key $a$: `77076d0a7318a57d3c16c17251b26645df4c2f87ebc0992ab177fba51db92c2a`
   - Bob Private Key $b$: `5dab087e624a8a4b79e17f8b83800ee66f3bb1292618b6fd1c2f8b27ff88e0eb`
   - Converged Shared Secret $K$: `4a5d9d5ba4ce2de1728e3bf480350f25e07e21c947d19e3376f09b3c1e161742` **[MATCH]**
3. **RFC 5869 HKDF-SHA256 Test Case 1 ($L=42$):**
   - Derived OKM matched reference vector bit-for-bit **[MATCH]**.
4. **FrodoKEM-976 Invariant KATs:**
   - Keypair generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation secret convergence **[MATCH]**.
   - Project Wycheproof degenerate points (Point 0, Point 1) verified to fail-closed.
5. **Shamir $\text{GF}(2^8)$ Secret Sharing KATs:**
   - 3-of-5 exact threshold and alternate subset reconstruction **[MATCH]**.
   - 2-of-5 insufficient share evaluation strictly failed-closed.

### 4. Pillar 3: dudect Statistical Timing Analysis (Welch's t-test)

Binary: `build/test_dudect_timing`

To empirically verify constant-time behavior beyond static assembly inspection, a `dudect`-style statistical hypothesis test was executed using Welch's two-sample $t$-test.

- **Class A:** 2,500 decapsulations of fixed nominal hybrid ciphertext.
- **Class B:** 2,500 decapsulations of adversarial corrupted ciphertext.
- **Timing Measurement:** CPU hardware timestamp counter (`__rdtscp`).

```
==================================================================
   QUANTUM FLEX // DUDECT STATISTICAL TIMING ANALYSIS (WELCH T)  
==================================================================
[*] Executing 5000 interleaved decapsulation measurements...
[*] Class A (Nominal) Mean Cycles:   497948 (stddev=10537.6)
[*] Class B (Corrupted) Mean Cycles: 497365 (stddev=8392.14)
[*] Welch t-statistic:               2.1606 (|t|=2.1606)
[*] dudect Threshold (|t| < 4.5):    PASS (Constant-time behavior NOT rejected)
```

**Statistical Conclusion:** The calculated Welch $t$-statistic is $|t| = 2.16$, which remains strictly below the standard critical threshold of $4.5$. The hypothesis that execution time depends on ciphertext validity is **not supported** by the timing data.

---

### 5. Pillar 4: Memory Zeroization & Rationale

Binary: `build/test_zeroization` (Compiled under `-O3`)

#### `OPENSSL_cleanse` Rationale & Defense-in-Depth

- **Why `OPENSSL_cleanse`:** Implemented via a volatile function pointer and compiler memory barrier in OpenSSL 3.x, preventing compiler dead-store elimination (DSE) across all optimization levels (`-O0` through `-O3`).
- **Standard Alternatives:** Serves the role filled by `explicit_bzero` (glibc/BSD) or C23 `memset_explicit`. Because Quantum Flex links `libcrypto`, `OPENSSL_cleanse` guarantees portable memory scrubbing without requiring external OS-specific symbols.
- **Memory Dump & Swap Protections:**
  - `CleanseVectorOnDrop` RAII guard guarantees stack-unwinding zeroization on exceptions.
  - Core dump memory scraping is prevented by configuring `RLIMIT_CORE = 0` and applying `madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP)` to long-lived key buffers.

#### Zeroization Test Results

1. **Stack Buffers (64 B):** Populated with entropy $\to$ `OPENSSL_cleanse` $\to$ volatile pointer verified 100% `0x00`.
2. **Heap Buffers (31,296 B):** Large secret key buffer $\to$ `OPENSSL_cleanse` under `-O3` $\to$ volatile pointer verified 100% `0x00`.
3. **Key Destruction Lifecycle:** `HybridPrivateKey` (`x25519_sk`, `frodo_sk`) verified non-zero $\to$ destructor/cleanse $\to$ physical memory wiped with `0x00`.
4. **Shamir Shards:** All 5 shard allocations physically scrubbed with `0x00` in RAM prior to release.

---

### 6. Pillar 5: Fail-Closed State Machine Testing

Binary: `build/test_wire_fuzz_negative` & `scripts/test_wycheproof_x25519.py`

1. **Header Corruption:** Corrupted magic bytes (`QF` $\to$ `XX`) and illegal protocol versions rejected fail-closed.
2. **Boundary Overflows:** Payload length set to $2^{32}-1$ and $\text{MAX\_PAYLOAD\_SIZE} + 1000$ aborted immediately; session state purged.
3. **Zero-Length Payload:** Declared payload length 0 rejected fail-closed.
4. **Stream Trickle:** Byte-by-byte fragmentation feeds reconstructed without buffer overflow or out-of-bounds reads.
5. **Anti-DoS Saturation:** 500 simultaneous partial sessions handled with clean LRU eviction and stable memory limits.
6. **Hostile Lattice Bit-Flips:** 10/10 single-bit inversions in FrodoKEM ciphertext matrices rejected fail-closed; derived secret strictly diverged.

## Part II: Operational Platform & Availability Resilience

*Note: Operational resilience and fault-tolerant infrastructure are distinguished from mathematical cryptographic validation.*

### 1. CPU Frequency & DVFS Side-Channel Defense

- **Audit Findings:** On the master host (AMD Ryzen AI 5 340), CPU scaling governor is `powersave` with operating temperatures at 40.0 °C.
- **Operational Hardening:** `scripts/set_yoga_power_policy.sh` configures systemd power policies and allows operator locking to `performance` to eliminate frequency scaling jitter during intensive cryptographic operations.

### 2. Power Loss & Node Failure Recovery (HP Pavilion Worker Node 2)

- **Node Profile:** HP Pavilion Desktop Tower (Debian GNU/Linux 13 *Trixie*, Intel Celeron 450 @ 2.20 GHz, 1.9 GB RAM).
- **Tailscale Mesh IP:** `100.82.53.126` (`qf-pavilion-worker`).
- **Container Resilience:** Docker CE running Kafka broker (`qf-kafka-broker`) and UI (`qf-kafka-ui`) configured with `restart: unless-stopped`.
- **Network Resilience:** `iptables-persistent` rules preserved in `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`.
- **Fault Recovery:** Uncontrolled power disconnect verified to trigger automatic BIOS AC recovery and headless systemd service restoration within 45 seconds.

### Workstation network posture (Yoga)

On the Fedora workstation, name-discovery responders (LLMNR, mDNS/Avahi,
WSD) were disabled, application listeners were constrained to `127.0.0.1`,
a single LAN default was pinned to USB Ethernet, and Tailscale remained
the mesh overlay. Physical-NIC input filtering was not independently
probe-tested. Packet-capture proof is a private host check and is not
part of the public artifact.

## Conclusion & Regulatory Demarcation

### 1. Explicit Distinction: Pre-Validation Engineering vs. Formal CMVP Certification

To ensure complete technical precision, avoid misleading procurement statements, and strictly demarcate internal engineering controls from government certifications:

| Evaluation Dimension | Internal Engineering Assurance (This Dossier) | Formal NIST FIPS 140-3 Validation / Certification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Evaluating Authority** | Internal Cryptographic Engineering Team (`FinallyFungus LLC`) | Independent Third-Party NVLAP-Accredited CST Laboratory + NIST/CCCS CMVP |
| **Testing Standard** | Internal test harness, `dudect` statistical analysis, and assembly inspection | Formal FIPS 140-3 Derived Test Requirements (DTR) & ACVP protocol |
| **Legal / Federal Status** | Internal engineering due-diligence & quality assurance | Statutory Federal Standard Compliance (FIPS PUB 140-3) |
| **CMVP Certificate** | **`NULL`** (None issued; none claimed) | Official Certificate Number published on the NIST CSRC CMVP database |
| **CAVP Algorithm Testing** | Self-administered KAT suite against published NIST reference vectors | Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol (ACVP) testing with CAVP Certificate |
| **CMVP Listing Status** | **NOT LISTED** (Not on IUT or MIP lists) | Listed on NIST CMVP Active / Validated Modules List |
| **Procurement Eligibility** | Technical due-diligence artifact; **cannot** fulfill federal FIPS-mandated clauses alone | Satisfies statutory federal procurement mandates (OMB M-26-15, FISMA, FedRAMP High) |

### 2. Precise Boundary of Claims

- **What This Dossier Demonstrates:**
  - Mature secure-coding practices and verified branchless machine-code execution for hybrid decapsulation across all compiler optimization levels (`-O0` through `-O3`).
  - Empirical statistical timing indistinguishability via `dudect` ($|t| = 2.1606 < 4.5$).
  - Bit-exact mathematical conformity to NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024), RFC 7748, and RFC 5869 reference vectors.
  - Physical volatile memory zeroization verified under `-O3` compiler optimization with volatile pointer inspection.
  - Strict fail-closed network framing, boundary bounds, and hostile wire fuzzing resistance.

- **What This Dossier Does NOT Constitute:**
  - **This software is NOT a FIPS 140-3 certified or validated cryptographic module.**
  - **This software has NOT been submitted to, tested by, or approved by an accredited NVLAP laboratory or the NIST/CCCS Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).**
  - The phrase "FIPS 140-3 aligned", "pre-validation evidence", or "security assurance artifact" refers exclusively to internal engineering design patterns and self-administered test suites. It does not confer, imply, or substitute for formal federal certification.
  - **Formal Regulatory Standing:** `CMVP Module Certificate: NULL` | `CAVP Algorithm Certificate: NULL` | `IUT / MIP Status: NONE`.

This dossier serves strictly as an internal engineering assurance artifact and pre-validation technical evidence package prepared for potential future third-party accredited laboratory assessment.
