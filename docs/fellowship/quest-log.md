# Quest Log

**Last updated:** 2026-10-20

## Open

Decisions and commitments that survive across sessions. One line per entry, dated.

- 2026-10-08 — DECIDED (Rock): admission requires attestation. `evaluate_all_invariants()` must not ADMIT unless a TPM quote is cryptographically verified; until quote verification exists, every composite verdict is DENY.
- 2026-10-08 — DECIDED (Rock): Option A — no push. Patches + encrypted backup only. Option B (empty private repo, new passphrase-protected SSH key, push cleaned history from Yoga, then layer branches if ancestors match) is revisited only after sort + credential rotation, not before.
- 2026-10-14 — FINDING: legacy 3-of-5 exposed on-host (shard 1 password in agent transcripts; shards 4–5 in an unencrypted stego PNG). Path chosen: offline authority migration to a new root, preserving the historical ledger. Only Claude sessions from here on.
- 2026-10-15 — DONE (CLAIMED by ceremony output; ledger/engine/tool hashes agent-checked): authority genesis sealed, manifest `~/.local/state/quantum-flex-mycelium/authority-genesis-20261015T121219Z.json`.
- 2026-10-15 — DONE: genesis topology disk-separation invariant verified. Share 2 moved off-host to `qf-g6:~/qfx-authority-share2/` (SHA-256: `811b157f...` matching manifest). Local `~/qfx-authority-share2/` removed from Yoga. Custody topology: Yoga: Share 1; G6: Share 2; USB QFX_SHARD_B: Shares 3 & 4; Pixel 11 Pro: Share 5.
- 2026-10-15 — DONE: Ollama GPU acceleration enabled on AMD Radeon 840M (Krackan Point `gfx1152` mapped to `gfx1150` via ROCm override in `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf`), verified 100% GPU offload under systemd override without CPU lockups.
- 2026-10-15 — DONE: Physical IBM Quantum experiments executed on real silicon (`ibm_fez`, Heron r2 156-qubit; Job `db8lbbtckpjs73b17plg` QRNG 3.9831 bits entropy; Job `db8lc6694fic73etkmt0` Bell state 68.95% correlation). Kept strictly isolated as research with zero engine entropy credit per NIST SP 800-90B.
- 2026-10-15 — DONE: Tailscale ACL policy updated and verified isolating Pixel 11 Pro (`100.126.7.67`) strictly to Yoga Ollama (`100.72.3.123:11434`), denying all sensitive services and node-to-node reachability.
- 2026-10-15 — OPEN: destroy pre-genesis shard material (`~/qfx-shards-genesis/`, stego PNG) only after confirming the old shares no longer authenticate the ledger.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): D-01. Home system and earning are separate products. Home-system v1 is the current re-alignment only (sentinel realign, engine ledger 0600 deploy, credential rotation); no new home-system features. Earning v1 is the PQC differential tester. Spec: `docs/fellowship/specs/aragorn-pqc-differential-tester.md`.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): D-02. The tester ships as a new, clean public repo with no history from mycelium/qf-public. The exception is that repo only; the 10-08 Option A no-push rule for mycelium stands.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): all agents' output (Antigravity, Codex, Claude) is Rock's own work. This supersedes the 10-14 "only Claude sessions" note.
- 2026-10-20 — DONE: fixes committed as `ef7b0a5` ("szf"): MCP Host/Origin allowlist, IBM runner `--submit` dry-run default, mainnet settlement guard, engine ledger 0600 source fix, CLAUDE.md runtime reality.
- 2026-10-20 — DONE: all user units enabled and running (Antigravity). Sentinel realigned and verified 15:55: digest read inside the container, baseline rebaselined to the container's postgres, DB_USER → ghostnode (`.env.bak-20261020-sentinel` kept), drive 486 < 1500, amara-matrix running. A leftover live-fire `ML_KEM_COMPROMISED=true` was cleared; ML-KEM-768 restored 15:48:38 after 4h on FrodoKEM.
- 2026-10-20 — DONE (Rock-run 17:33): engine ledger 0600 fix deployed. New binary `d1e90002…` (truth log §19.9); genesis binary kept. Engine is LOCKED, and ledger.dat is unchanged.
- 2026-10-20 — OPEN: rotate creds exposed in ~/.gemini/antigravity transcripts: GitHub PAT first, then IBM token, Circle TEST key + entity secret, DB passwords, and possibly the seal key.
- 2026-10-20 — DONE: `suspicious_urls` table provisioned in Postgres; Sentinel OSINT errors cleared. Neurogenesis tested directly with ghostnode credentials (exit 0) and systemd failed state reset.
- 2026-10-20 — DONE: public settlement hardening committed (`fa67bb8`) and pushed to `origin/codex/public-readiness-hardening` on `rahshaun44-byte/quantumflex`.
- 2026-10-20 — OPEN: qf-bot still also listens on 0.0.0.0:9001 (LAN). Serve proxies to loopback, so binding qf-bot to 127.0.0.1 keeps the Pixel's HTTPS path working and closes the LAN port. Confirm the Pixel app uses the ts.net HTTPS name first.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): tester D-03 to D-06. Crucible JSON-line protocol for the KAT, negative and differential suites, with dudect in-process per target (D-03). Targets: RustCrypto ml-dsa/ml-kem, @noble/post-quantum, Go crypto/mldsa; fallback libcrux-ml-dsa (D-04). Apache-2.0 (D-05). Upstream SECURITY.md, else 90-day embargo (D-06). Still open: repo name and GitHub account.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): Hard Real-Node & Zero-Fedora Invariant locked (truth log §19.11). Host is Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS on qfx-yoga (Pluton TPM 2.0). There is NO Fedora, NO HP Pavilion, and NO Galaxy S23 FE. Active real nodes are qfx-yoga, qfx-pixel, and g6pro only.
- 2026-10-20 — DECIDED (Rock): Formal disavowal of qresear.ch, QAnon, and QFS ("Quantum Financial System") conspiracy mythology (truth log §19.12). QuantumFlex operates strictly on verified post-quantum mathematics (FIPS 203/204), Circle USDC (6 decimals), and bare-metal real nodes.
- 2026-10-22 — DONE: Pixel 11 Pro Tailscale IP updated to true active IP 100.108.225.93 (`pixel-11-pro-1`, DERP/mesh verified). Updated bot_server.py, teammates.py, ACL policies (JSON/HuJSON), handoff specs, and truth log §19.13.
