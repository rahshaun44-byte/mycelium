## [2026-07-15 11:12] — Pre-Shutdown Verification & Hardening

### Actions Taken
1. **Deployed hardened amara-matrix container** (postgres:15-alpine)
   - Bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` only — no public exposure
   - Read-only root filesystem with tmpfs for /tmp, /run, /var/run/postgresql
   - `no-new-privileges:true` enforced
   - Resource clamped: 2G RAM / 1.5 CPU
   - `pg_isready` verified: **ACCEPTING CONNECTIONS** ✅
2. **n8n-orchestrator pull blocked** — Docker Hub unauthenticated rate limit hit
   - Image: `docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:latest`
   - **ACTION NEEDED ON NEXT BOOT**: Re-run `podman compose up -d` from `/home/USERNAME/quantum-flex/` or authenticate with Docker Hub
3. **Restarted user services**:
   - `qf-monitor.service` → **ACTIVE (running)** ✅
   - `swarm-worker.service` → **ACTIVE (running)** ✅
4. **Cleaned up failed/dead services**:
   - `ghost-node-agent.service` → stopped (was already inactive/dead)
   - `sentinel-drive.service` → reset failed state (was exit-code=1)

### Known Issues to Address on Next Boot
1. **sentinel-drive.service** — crash-looping with exit-code=1. Investigate `/home/USERNAME/mycelium/sentinel/sentinel.py`
2. **qf-monitor.service** — was in auto-restart loop before DB came up. Now stable with amara-matrix running
3. **n8n-orchestrator** — needs image pull retry (rate-limited). Run: `podman compose up -d` from `~/quantum-flex/`
4. **Port 80** — bound to `0.0.0.0` (public). Verify this is intentional or lock to localhost
5. **ghost-node-agent.service** — has `StartLimitIntervalSec` in wrong `[Service]` section (should be in `[Unit]`)

### Project File Locations
| Project          | Path                                          | Git Tracked |

## [2026-08-12 07:04] — Mycelium Engine Gets a Systemd Unit (Isolated from Root)

### Actions Taken
1. **Gave the mycelium C++ engine (`quantum_flex_engine`) its own systemd user unit**,
   deliberately isolated from the live root `quantum-flex-engine.service` (port 9443,
   `127.0.0.1`) rather than replacing it — no PKI and no unlock path existed for
   mycelium's copy at session start, so replacing the root deployment outright was ruled out.
2. **`src/main.cpp`**: `QF_BIND_ADDRESS`/`QF_BIND_PORT` env overrides (defaults unchanged,
   so root deployment behavior is unaffected).
3. **Fixed a real shutdown bug**, found live during testing: `std::signal()` installs
   handlers with `SA_RESTART` on glibc, so SIGTERM never interrupted the blocking
   `accept()` call — the engine would hang until systemd's SIGKILL timeout instead of
   gracefully persisting the ledger. Switched to `sigaction()` with `SA_RESTART` cleared.
4. **Fixed a real protocol bug**: raw Shamir shard bytes can contain `,`/`:` — the
   `INIT|`/`UNLOCK|` wire format's own delimiters — corrupting parsing ~1 in 4 times.
   Both `parse_shares` (`ipc_server.cpp`) and the new `qf_genesis_tool` now hex-encode
   shard payloads consistently.
5. **New tooling**: `tools/genesis_tool.cpp` (`qf_genesis_tool` — split/recover, links the
   engine's own GF(256) `ShamirSecretSharing`), `scripts/generate_mycelium_pki.sh`
   (user-scoped CA/server/client certs + Ed25519/ML-DSA-65 signing keys),
   `scripts/qf_ipc_client.py` (mTLS transport only, no crypto logic).
6. **Added unlock/genesis audit trail** (`[AUDIT]` line, timestamped, distinct from the
   existing status log) and **memory cleansing**: `OPENSSL_cleanse` on recovered shard
   payloads and the raw wire buffer after use, matching the existing
   `Ed25519Signer::export_key_shards` convention.
7. **Deleted `sentinel/ceremony/`** (Groth16/circom trusted-setup output regenerated by
   a concurrent session) and restored the `.gitignore` exclusion for it — no code path
   in this repo consumes Groth16 proofs; `LocalNode`'s `ZkCommitment` is plain salted
   SHA-256. A prior session had already flagged this exact class of artifact invalid;
   the gitignore entry just hadn't survived into the tracked file.
8. **Full genesis → unlock → telemetry path verified end to end**, twice (once manually,
   once under the actual systemd unit with `systemctl restart`): fresh boot →
   `UNINITIALIZED` → `qf_genesis_tool split` → `INIT|` → `ACK|GENESIS_SECURED` → restart →
   `LOCKED` → independent 3-of-5 shard subset → `UNLOCK|` → `ACK|NODE_UNLOCKED` →
   `SET_HARVESTER_KEY|` + signed `TELEMETRY|` → `ACK|EVIDENCE_ACCEPTED`.

### System State at Close
| Service                          | Status | Binding                | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|-------|
| quantum-flex-engine-mycelium.service | active (running) | `127.0.0.1:9444` | New. Isolated, own PKI/data dir, `LOCKED` by default. |
| quantum-flex-engine.service (root)   | active (running) | `127.0.0.1:9443` | Untouched all session — confirmed via port check after every restart of the mycelium unit. |
| active-defense.service            | active (running) | — | Untouched. |
| amara-dashboard / athena-node / qf-monitor | active (running) | — | Untouched. |

### Commits This Session (all pushed to `origin/main`)
- `9819fdb` Restore .gitignore exclusion for invalidated zk-ceremony artifacts
- `efb4d7a` Give the mycelium C++ engine a systemd unit, isolated from the root deployment
- `6214632` Add unlock/genesis audit trail and cleanse shard memory after use

### Known Issues to Address Next Session
1. **The root `quantum-flex-engine.service` almost certainly shares the same SIGTERM/accept()
   bug** fixed in mycelium's engine tonight (same source lineage, same `std::signal()`
   pattern) — not verified or patched, since that deployment was treated as out of scope
   for this session. Worth a read-only check (`systemctl status`, journal for restart-timeout
   patterns) before ever relying on graceful restarts there.
2. **`~/mycelium/certs/`** — an untracked CA/server/client Ed25519 keyset (user-confirmed,
   self-generated, unrelated to the verified mycelium deployment's actual PKI under
   `~/.local/share/quantum-flex-mycelium/mtls/`). Not wired to anything; left in place.
3. **Sentinel → ledger auto-write is an open, unconfirmed decision.** `lif_sentinel.py`'s
   `fire()` is deliberately alert-only (see prior commit `bef7a6a` and the comment at
   `lif_sentinel.py:52-55`) — auto-committing detected threats to the ledger would reverse
   that, and hasn't been explicitly approved. No code changed here.
4. **Merkle sealing over `EvidenceEngine`'s state root** — currently a flat SHA-256 over all
   sorted `(evidence_id, hash)` pairs, fully recomputed every call. Already tamper-evident;
   a real Merkle tree would only add O(log n) incremental updates and per-item inclusion
   proofs. Not urgent, not started.
5. **Mycelium engine's `QF_POSTGRES_CONNINFO` deliberately left unset** — `main.cpp` runs
   a `BaeNode::neurogenesis_purge("test_partition")` test sequence on every boot when that
   var is set, which shouldn't fire repeatedly under `Restart=on-failure` without a
   deliberate decision to wire it up for real.

## [2026-08-13 21:17 EDT] — Public Release Sanitization, History Rewrite, and Standalone Extract

### Actions Taken
1. **Repo flipped private before touching anything**, since it had already been made
   public with the real username, real Tailscale IPs, and `sentinel/neutralize.sh`
   (the hardware-triggered emergency wipe script) sitting in a tracked, pushed commit.
   `gh` was unauthenticated at session start — required an interactive `gh auth login`
   before any GitHub-side action was possible.
2. **Working-tree scrub**: `rahshaunchambers` → `USERNAME` across 20 tracked files,
   real Tailscale IPs (`100.126.148.59`, `100.120.30.95`) → `127.0.0.1` across 8,
   `sentinel/neutralize.sh` untracked (`git rm --cached`) and gitignored — file stays
   on disk, just stops shipping. Committed as `c432ce9` (later rewritten, see below).
   Deliberately skipped renaming `GHOSTNODE_DB_USER`/`SENTINEL_DB_USER`-style env vars —
   project jargon, not identifying info, and renaming only those would desync `.env`
   from the rest of the codebase for no privacy benefit.
3. **Full history rewrite via `git filter-repo`**: `--replace-text` for the username/IP
   pairs plus `--path sentinel/neutralize.sh --invert-paths` to purge the script from
   every past commit, then a second pass with `--replace-message` after discovering
   `--replace-text` doesn't touch commit messages — one old merge commit had leaked the
   real path via a stray `nano` status-line artifact in its commit message text, not
   file content. Backed up pre-rewrite state to a local `git bundle` first. Force-pushed
   the rewritten history (`--force-with-lease`); repo flipped back to public afterward
   per explicit instruction.
4. **Ultrareview caught 4 real regressions** in the scrub itself, all fixed and pushed
   as `fe97c12`:
   - Real full name ("Rahshaun Chambers", not just the lowercase username) was still
     live in `amara/dashboard.py`, `quantum_flex_architecture.md`, and
     `sentinel/knowledge_base/quantum_flex_architecture.txt` — the original grep only
     searched for the Linux username string, missing the separate capitalized-name
     string entirely.
   - The `/home/USERNAME/...` literal-string substitutions broke every runtime call
     site that used them directly with no `expanduser`/env-var fallback
     (`api_node/main.py`, `mcp_layer/vector_ingest.py`, `sentinel/iac_deployer.py`,
     `sentinel/sentinel.py`, `sentinel/start_bundle_server.sh`) — fine for docs/systemd
     backups, broken for live code. Switched to `os.path.expanduser("~/...")` / `${HOME}`.
   - `immune_daemon.py`'s `DASHBOARD_WEBHOOK` scrub (Tailscale IP → `127.0.0.1`) broke
     container reachability: the daemon runs inside the pqc-worker pod's own network
     namespace, where `127.0.0.1` is the pod's loopback, not the host's. Made it
     env-driven like `OPA_ENDPOINT` already was, defaulting to `10.0.2.2` (the same
     host-from-pod address `launch_immune_pod.sh` already uses for
     `BUNDLE_SERVER_URL`).
   - Shortened the `neutralize.sh` `.gitignore` comment so it no longer describes what
     the excluded script does — the file being untracked is enough; spelling out its
     function in a published, tracked file was its own small leak.
   - Two other review findings investigated and **not** acted on: the claim that
     `neutralize.sh` was "still tracked, gitignore is a no-op" was stale — it was
     checked against a repo snapshot from before the `filter-repo` rewrite (confirmed:
     the commit hash it cited no longer exists post-rewrite). A claimed internal
     contradiction in this file's own `[2026-08-12 07:04]` entry (root engine binding)
     didn't hold up — diffed against the pre-rewrite backup bundle and found those
     specific lines were already `127.0.0.1` before this session touched anything;
     left un-"fixed" rather than guess at a "correct" historical value with no way to
     verify it.
5. **New standalone repo carved out**: `github.com/rahshaun44-byte/pqc-immune-daemon`
   (public, Apache 2.0 — chosen over MIT specifically for the explicit patent grant,
   which matters more than usual for cryptographic code). Extracts `immune_daemon.py`,
   `membrane_health.rego`, and an example provider config as a portfolio-evidence
   piece, with a README that explicitly does **not** claim OMB M-26-15 "compliance" —
   only that it implements the specific mechanisms (provider-based config, automated
   CBOM snapshot, signal-driven renegotiation without rebuild) that memo describes.
   Added one real test (`test_immune_daemon.py`) that feeds a synthetic TOXIC verdict
   through `execute_vein_collapse()` and asserts the config file is actually rewritten
   and daemon state actually updates — run and confirmed passing, not just written.
6. **Security false alarm, resolved**: a claim surfaced (from a conversation outside
   this session) that an unrecognized SSH key named "Quantum Flex Master Node" was
   added to the GitHub account on Aug 12. Verified directly via `gh ssh-key list`
   (after an interactive `gh auth refresh -s admin:public_key`) — the key was real
   (added 2026-08-12T08:15:10Z, id `160007215`), initially treated as a possible
   compromise and deleted (`gh ssh-key delete`, confirmed via `gh api user/keys`
   returning `[]`) before the operator confirmed it was their own, legitimate action.
   No further account-security response was needed once confirmed.
7. **Tailscale tailnet audited** at operator request ("delete and start fresh") —
   `tailscale status --json` showed only two devices (`yoga` / this PC, and the
   Android phone), both online, both with key expiry enabled (not disabled) and ~6
   months out. Nothing stale or unrecognized; no action taken, tailnet already in the
   state requested.

### System State at Close
| Item | State |
|---|---|
| `github.com/rahshaun44-byte/mycelium` | Public, HEAD `fe97c12`, zero hits for real name/username/IPs in current tree or full history. |
| `github.com/rahshaun44-byte/pqc-immune-daemon` | Public, new, HEAD `5d3d42e`, Apache 2.0, test passing. |
| `sentinel/neutralize.sh` | On disk, untracked, gitignored. Never published under the current history. |
| GitHub SSH keys (`gh api user/keys`) | Empty — the one flagged key was deleted; operator has since confirmed it was theirs (no replacement added this session). |
| Tailscale tailnet | 2 devices (`yoga`, phone), both online, key expiry enabled. Unchanged. |

### Commits This Session
- `mycelium@d81fe6a` (rewritten history, was `c432ce9` pre-rewrite) — Scrub real username and Tailscale IPs before public release
- `mycelium@fe97c12` — Fix regressions from the earlier sanitization pass
- `pqc-immune-daemon@5d3d42e` — Initial commit: PQC crypto-agility immune daemon

### Known Issues to Address Next Session
1. **GitHub account 2FA status was flagged but not verified this session** — operator
   was mid-check when the session's focus moved to the truth log. Worth confirming
   `github.com/settings/security` shows 2FA enabled, given a real (if
   operator-authorized) SSH key was added to the account this month.
2. **Anyone who cloned the repo during its earlier public window** still has the
   unscrubbed history (real name, real IPs, `neutralize.sh` contents). The rewrite and
   force-push only protect what's on GitHub going forward — this can't be undone
   retroactively.
3. **`certs/` remains untracked, `*.crt` files are not gitignored** (only `*.key` is).
   Inspected one cert this session (`certs/server.crt`) and it's already generic
   (`CN=127.0.0.1`, no real hostname), so not urgent — but the gap in `.gitignore`
   coverage is real if that ever changes.
